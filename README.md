This boilerplate is based on [Turborepo](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo).
It uses [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `web`: A [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) based app with typescript,wagmi,rainbowkit,ether.js
- `contracts`: hardhat,typescript,chai,ethers
- `storybook`: storybook
- `api`: basic skeleton back-end structure with typescript
- `ui`: a custom shared ui component library
- `lib`: sdk library for core instances
- `config`: lint and common config configurations
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo
- `husky`: lint staged pre-commit check


### Stack 

This starter kit contains:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) framework
- [WAGMI Hooks](https://github.com/tmm/wagmi) advanced web3 react hooks
- [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js) integrate with blockchain
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindui.com/) Utility-First Fundamentals
- [Typechain](https://github.com/dethcrypto/TypeChain) to keep those end-to-end types generated from ABIs
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) Deploy && compile smart Contracts

### NOTE: 
I recommend the following extension to make it easy to switch among packages in your mono repo, as well as open multiple under a single workspace. It makes mono repos work well with the test explorer extension.
